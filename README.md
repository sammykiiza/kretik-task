# Basic CRUD Application

This is a basic CRUD application using React with json-server as a dummy server.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm i`

Run this command before starting the application in order to install the project dependencies

You should also run `npm i -g json-server` to install the json-server on your system globally for you to be able to run it.

### `npm run dev`

This starts the application in development mode with the backend end (json-server).

The client app runs on [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) while the backend runs on [http://localhost:3001/data](http://localhost:3001/data)
